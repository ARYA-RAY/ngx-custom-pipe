## Reporting a Vulnerability 

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. 
Thank you for improving the security of this project. 
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure. We will
make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security vulnerabilities by emailing the Atsign security team at:

Maintainers will acknowledge your email within 24 hours, and will
send a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in 
handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we
will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and may ask for 
additional information or guidance.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it
to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release
process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes
    will be released as fast as possible to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) where applicable.
